	Project 10 required us to write our own list class featuring two different methods of storing the data. One method stored the data in an array of values and the other method created a node for each value. The array list meant limited size which has the benefit of not using all memory while the node list allows for infinite size so long as there is enough memory available for a new node. Lists work much like normal arrays and I felt they were relatively easy to work with.
	Given more time I would have made a test driver which would check more things. I only checked to see if the two insert functions worked, if remove worked, and if clear worked. I had some issues with the insert after function where for some reason the value for cursor would be displayed incorrectly but the data is still inserted at the right spot. I decided to just let the bug go because every solution I tried completely broke the algorithm.
